I) Problem is to delete the middle node

D) Goal is to find a away to delete the middle node from a linked list

E/A) Dukes 7

1) Work some small instances by hand A->B->C->..... A->C
2) Write down what you did I looked for matching pairs looking at every letter.
3) Find Patterns. Pretty straight foward. Gotta probably have two pointers
4) Check by hand.
5) Translate to code Code seen in pyhton file
6) Run Test Cases Done in compiler
7) Debug Test Cases

L) I learned that finding the mid point ini a linked list is trickier then it sounds. You must know where it is, but still
make a connection from the node before it to the node after it.
