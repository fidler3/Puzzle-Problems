I) The problem was to compare two strings and if given three operations, insert, delete, replace if given one move if they could be made 
equal.

D) Goal was to make the strings be equal to eachother using one of the given operations.

1) Work some small instances by hand. Looking at the examples we see that there are unique cases. In all cases where the string len differece
if the two strings is more then one it's false. Then if a string has the same characters in order but is longer or shorter by just one it can
be made the same using a insert or delete. If they are the same length and there is one error that error needs to be replaced.
2) Write down what you did. In all cases where the string len differece
if the two strings is more then one it's false. Then if a string has the same characters in order but is longer or shorter by just one it can
be made the same using a insert or delete. If they are the same length and there is one error that error needs to be replaced. 
3) Find Patterns.  Same as in 2
4) Check by hand- 
5) Translate to code Code seen in pyhton file
6) Run Test Cases Done in compiler
7) Debug Test Cases- This one took a lot of test cases, I originally made a bunch of errors, and it took time before I realized the three cases
for the strings.

L) Learned about thinking about turning things into specific cases of comparison.
