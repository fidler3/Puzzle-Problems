I) The problem was to check to see if two strings were permutations of eachother

D) Goal is to find if the two strings are made up of the same characters

E/A) Dukes 7

1) Work some small instances by hand iceman, cinema - True
2) Write down what you did I looked for matching pairs looking at every letter.
3) Thinking back to problem one I thought it could be easily done by sorting the two words and comparing the strings. 
4) Check by hand- iceman and cinema sorted are both aceimn
5) Translate to code Code seen in pyhton file
6) Run Test Cases Done in compiler
7) Debug Test Cases

L) I learned that sorting can definetly help with comparison of characters and in other cases strings
