I) The problem was to see if all the characters of a string were unique.



D)Goal is to find matching character pairs else reply true



E/A) Dukes 7

1) Work some small instances by hand
abcd - True
abidd - False
2) Write down what you did
I looked for matching pairs looking at every letter.
3) Find Patterns
I realized it would be easier if the string was sorted I could check the characters next to eachother
4) Check by hand
abcd - True
abddi - False
5) Translate to code
Code seen in pyhton file
6) Run Test Cases
Done in compiler
7) Debug Test Cases



L) I learned that sorting can definetly help with comparison of characters and in other cases strings
