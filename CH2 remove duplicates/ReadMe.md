I) The problem was to remove deuplicate nodes

D) Goal is to find matching items in a linked list

E/A) Dukes 7

 1) Work some small instances by hand. A->B->A->C_->.... to A->B->C
2) Write down what you did. Have a set containing the items we've already iterated through then compare the new items to whats in the set.
3) Find Patterns.There's not really a pattern, but we do need a place to store what we already know.
4) Check by hand. Kinda done in the small instances by hand.
5) Translate to code Code seen in pyhton file
6) Run Test Cases.
7) Debug Test Cases.
L) We see that using a set or in our case in python another list is powerful when you're looking for liked types.
